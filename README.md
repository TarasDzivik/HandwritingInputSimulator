# HandwritingInputSimulator
This is just a simple WPF application created for fun on MVVM pattern (without the 'Models' ) by me to draw attention to my job search LinkedIn post.
This app has just a Button and a TextBlock for showing imitations of the handwriting of a text.
There is no implemented close the window button (just use Alt+F4 to close the program) or loading the text button (text was just hardcoded).
I've added a quickly-made design, triggers for the button, some styles, and implemented dragging the window.
